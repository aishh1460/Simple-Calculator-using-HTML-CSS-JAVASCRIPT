 Day 1: Calculator App â€” HTML, CSS & JavaScript

 LIVE DEMO: https://aishh1460.github.io/Simple-Calculator-using-HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT/
 
Welcome to Day 1 of my Full-Stack Developer Journey!

To kick things off, Iâ€™ve built a fully functional calculator web app using only HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript.

This project marks the beginning of my hands-on learning in frontend development and is my first step toward mastering the full stack. Through this project, I focused on understanding the core building blocks of web development â€” structure, styling, and interactivity â€” without relying on frameworks.

Features:
*Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

*Keyboard Support: Use keys like 0-9, +, -, *, /, Enter, Backspace, and Escape.

*Responsive UI: Styled layout with a clean, user-friendly interface.

*Live Input Display: Shows both current input and previous operation context.

*Clear (AC) and Delete (DEL) Buttons.
